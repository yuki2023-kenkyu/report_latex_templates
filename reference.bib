  abstract  = {We present a model for a classical, non-singular bouncing cosmology without violation of the null energy condition (NEC). The field content is General Relativity plus a real scalar field with a canonical kinetic term and only renormalizable, polynomial-type self-interactions for the scalar field in the Jordan frame. The universe begins vacuum-energy dominated and is contracting at t=-??. We consider a closed universe with a positive spatial curvature, which is responsible for the universe bouncing without any NEC violation. An R?2 coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field drives the scalar field from the initial false vacuum to the true vacuum during the bounce. The model is sub-Planckian throughout its evolution and every dimensionful parameter is below the effective-field-theory scale MP, so we expect no ghost-type or tachyonic instabilities. This model solves the horizon problem and extends co-moving particle geodesics to past infinity, resulting in a geodesically complete universe without singularities. We solve the Friedman equations and the scalar-field equation of motion numerically, and analytically under certain approximations.},

Such a bounce is sometimes referred to as a Tolman wormhole. We subject the bounce to a general model-independent analysis along the lines of that applied to the Morris–Thorne traversable wormholes, and show that there is always an open temporal region surrounding the bounce over which the strong energy condition (SEC) must be violated. On the other hand, all the other energy conditions can easily be satisfied. In particular, we exhibit an inflation-inspired model in which a big bounce is “natural”.},

  abstract = { A new theorem on space-time singularities is presented which largely incorporates and generalizes the previously known results. The theorem implies that space-time singularities are to be expected if either the universe is spatially closed or there is an ‘object’ undergoing relativistic gravitational collapse (existence of a trapped surface) or there is a point p whose past null cone encounters sufficient matter that the divergence of the null rays through p changes sign somewhere to the past of p (i. e. there is a minimum apparent solid angle, as viewed from p for small objects of given size). The theorem applies if the following four physical assumptions are made: (i) Einstein’s equations hold (with zero or negative cosmological constant), (ii) the energy density is nowhere less than minus each principal pressure nor less than minus the sum of the three principal pressures (the ‘energy condition’), (iii) there are no closed timelike curves, (iv) every timelike or null geodesic enters a region where the curvature is not specially alined with the geodesic. (This last condition would hold in any sufficiently general physically realistic model.) In common with earlier results, timelike or null geodesic incompleteness is used here as the indication of the presence of space-time singularities. No assumption concerning existence of a global Cauchy hypersurface is required for the present theorem. },
